### Main Project Documentation: CreditMate

---

#### **Project Description**

CreditMate is a system designed to calculate loan installments based on provided parameters. The application's backend checks whether the loan's interest rate exceeds the reference rate. If it does, it returns a response without calculations. Otherwise, it calculates the installment value and the remaining contract balance, saving the results in the database.
